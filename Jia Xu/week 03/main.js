// app is what we will call a "module".
// it is a Global variable. And an Object.
// app is equal to an Immediately Invoked Function Expression.
// That is why the function is wrapped in parentheses like this:
/*
	var myObject = (function() {
	
		return {
			foo : bar,
			peanut : butter
		};

	})();

	now, in this example myObject is equal to:

	var myObject = {foo: bar, peanut: butter}
	The reason we use this technic is that it allows us to have "private"
	and "public" members. 

	In the example below, all the "var"s are hidden from the world outside.
	ONLY those that are "returned" at the end are visible when you type in your console "app".

	// Everytime we query the page for an element, we are performing an expensive operation.
	// Because out browser has to traverse thgough all the HTML nodes every single time to find the element
	// we need. So we save a reference to them once. In large apps, this will result in significant increase in speed.
